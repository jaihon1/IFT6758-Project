## Warmup
Analyzing sports is becoming more and more valuable with the growth of various sensors and technology. In the case of hockey in partiular, be it a goalie or skater, there are certainly a wide range of metrics available for us to analyze the performace of hockey player.

### Question 1
In the case of hockey goalies, although using the Save Percentage (SV%) is a relatively good metric to measure a goalie's performance, it is certainly not without a set of limitations. The main one being the number of games played by the goalies.

> Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, it is a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal (Wikipedia, Save Percentage).

*Here is more information on [save percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_percentage).*

For example, if we compare a goalie who only played one game to another goalie who played 50 games during the season. If the goalie who played the single game ended the game with zero goals conceded, he will have an average SV% of 100.00. In contrast, the goalie who played 50 games and has an average SV% of 95.00 will look like he was worst than the one with 100.00 SV%. Where in reality, the goalie who played only one game might had an "easier game" or even possibly only had to save a very low amount of low quality shots. Here is a visualization of the top 20 nhl goalies from the 2017-2018 season solely based on their save percentage metric:

Save percentage is probably the best metric we have for capturing a player's ability to stop shots but it is swamped by random variance, team effects and potentially sample size issues that kill any hope at meaningful confidence intervals. It leads to very little repeatability in goaltender performance, which makes it a struggle to forecast what many players will do in upcoming years.
The rule of thumb is that you would like to have a goalie’s save percentage to be 0.915% or higher. The league average is 0.910%.


A better metric would be for instance to set an inclusion criteria based on a preset threshold of games played for each goalie. For example, setting a threshold of at least 10 games played before even considering the goalie's performance on the 'Top goalies' analysis. This would be a way to control the 'low number of shots received with high number of saves' bias. Another, slighlty different inclusion criteria could be to simply set a threshold for the number of shots received by each goalie.

### Question 2
Here is a filtered visualization where we applied a mask that excluded goalies that had less than 10 games played during that same season:

### Question 3
There are many features that could optimise the estimation of a goalie's performance. Save Percentage, although limited in it's interpretation is actually quite relevant when used appropriately and within it's set of limitations. Here are a couple of features that could potentially be useful in determining a goalie's performance.

A useful feature could be the SV% for each of the 3 periods. This could be an indicator of performance in function of time, although this feature would again be subject to similar limitation as previously discussed. On the other hand, if the inclusion criterias are set in a way to reduce the bias discussed previously in question 1, then this feature could be quite interesting to measure if a goalie's performance decreases, remains stable, or increases as the game progresses.

Another interesting variation of the save percentage would be to observe and experiment with is the goalie's SV% during different states of a game. Such as the SV% when the goalie's team is leading, equal or trailling.

Taking a look at where (in terms of a 2D space representing the surface of the goal's entrance) the goalie seems to be the most efficient in saving/conceding shots could definitly be a useful feature to highlight the strengths/weaknesses of a goalie's performance. If for instance most shots a goalie conceeds are located on the top-right space of the grid, then that information could definitly be useful in different ways. The same type of information could be used but instead of using the 2D grid as a representation of the goal, it could be the location of the shot's origin point on the ice. This would give a useful indicator of a goalies performance in terms of where he/she is receiving a shot from on the ice. These two features could also be combined into one. It would also be relevant to use a feature measuring the goalie's performance in 1 v 1 scenarios for instance in the penalty shots scenario.

Also for the longest time, the most important stat for an NHL goalie was his Goals Against Average (“GAA”) which is simply the average number of goals let in per game. However, as the stats world developed GAA came to be seen as a better indicator of team performance than individual performance.

###Data Acquisition :

Question:
Tutorial for the use of the GamesInfo class by our team:



After importing the libraries glob, requests, json, et os,
we create an instance object of the class, by calling the class using the class name
GamesInfo and passing the arguments that the initialization method accepts.

The first argument we pass is the season we want, then the second argument is the filepath
where to download the files in our situation but also in the case the files were already
downloaded. The third argument is games_info(dictionary of all the
games information) and is None by default.

Once the instance is created with the argumnents, the class Games Info then generates an object
that contains all of the regular and playoff games from the specified seasons.

It is also possible to access the object's method by using the dot operator with the object.

In our case we only need the Download method, that downloaded and saved the json files from
corresponding seasons in the specified filepath, then it returns a list of all the information
about all the games of the season.

The class also have the load method, the add_season method, and the add method that we added
in the class to be able to load the json files already downloaded, the add_season method that
adds the games from a new season and the add method that combines two GamesInfo object together,
and add all the games from one GamesInfo to the other.
