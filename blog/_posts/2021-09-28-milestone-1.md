## Warmup
Analyzing sports is becoming more and more valuable with the growth of various sensors and technology. In the case of hockey in partiular, be it a goalie or skater, there are certainly a wide range of metrics available for us to analyze the performace of hockey player.

### Question 1
In the case of hockey goalies, although using the Save Percentage (SV%) is a relatively good metric to measure a goalie's performance, it is certainly not without a set of limitations. The main one being the number of games played by the goalies.

> Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, it is a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal.

*Here is more information on [save percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_percentage).*

For example, if we compare a goalie who only played one game to another goalie who played 50 games during the season. If the goalie who played the single game and ended the game with zero goals conceded, he will have an average SV% of 100.00. In contrast, the goalie who played 50 games and has an average SV% of 95.00 will look like he was worst than the one with 100.00 SV%. Where in reality, the goalie who played only one game might had an "easier game" or even possibly only had to save a very low amount of low quality shots. Here is a visualization of the top 20 nhl goalies from the 2017-2018 season solely based on their save percentage metric:

A better metric would be for instance to set an inclusion criteria based on a preset threshold of games played for each goalie. For example, setting a threshold of at least 10 games played before even considering the goalie's performance on the 'Top goalies' analysis. This would be a way to control the 'low number of shots received with high number of saves' bias. Another, slighlty different inclusion criteria could be to simply set a threshold for the number of shots received by each goalie.

### Question 2
Here is a filtered visualization where we applied a mask that excluded goalies that had less than 10 games played during that same season:

### Question 3
There are many features that could optimise the estimation of a goalie's performance. Save Percentage, although limited in it's interpretation is actually quite relevant when used appropriately and within it's set of limitations. Here are a couple of features that could potentially be usefull in determining a goalie's performance.

A usefull feature could be the SV% for each of the 3 periods. This could be an indicator of performance in function of time, although this feature would again be subject to similar limitation as previously discussed. On the other hand, if the inclusion criterias are set in a way to reduce the bias discussed previously in question 1, then this feature could be quite interesting to measure if a goalie's performance decrease, remains stable, or increases as the game progresses.

Another variation of the save percentage would be interesting to observe and experiment with is the goalie's SV% during different states of a game. Such as the SV% when the goalie's team is leading, equal or trailling.

Taking a look at where (in terms of a 2D space representing the surface of the goal's entrance) the goalie seems to be most efficient in saving/conceding shots could definetly be a usefull feature to highlight the strenghts/weaknesses of a goalie's performance. If for instance most shots a goalie conceeds are located on the top-right space of the grid, then that information could definetly be usefull in different ways. The same type of information could be used but instead of using the 2D grid as a representation of the goal, it could be the location of the shot origin point on the ice, this would give a usefull indicator of a goalies performance in terms of where he/she is receiving a shot from on the ice. These two features could also be combined into one. It would also be relevant to use a feature measuring the goalie's performance in 1 v 1 scenarios for instance in the penalty shots scenario.
