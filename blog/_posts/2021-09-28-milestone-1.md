## Warmup
### Question 1
Although using the Save Percentage (SV%) is a relatively good metric to measure a goalie's performance, it is certainly not without a set of limitations. For instance, the main one being the number of games played by the goalies. For example, goalies who played one game compared to another goalie who played 50 games. If a goalie played only one game and ended the game with zero goals conceded, he will have an average of 100.00 SV% for this metric. In contrast, a goalie who played 50 games and has an average of 95.00 SV% will look like he was worst than the one with 100.00 SV%. Where in reality, the goalie who played only one game might had an "easier game" or only had to save one shot, which leads to our second issue. A better metric would be for instance to set an inclusion criteria based on a threshold of games played for each goalie. For example, setting a threshold of at least 10 games played before inculding that goalies performance on the 'Top goalies' analysis would be a way to control for the 'low number of shots received and high number of saves' bias. Another more direct inclusion criteria could be to simply set a threshold for the number of shots received by each goalie.

### Question 2
Both these graphs were generated using the top 20 goalies based on their SV%. Graph 1 applied a mask that excluded goalies that had less than 10 games played. Graph 2 included all goalies, independantly of the numbers of games played.

### Question 3
There are many features that could optimise the estimation of a goalie's performance. Save Percentage, although limited in it's interpretation is actually quite relevant when used appropriately and within it's set of limitations. Another usefull feature could be the SV% for each of the 3 periods. This could be an indicator of performance in function of time, although this feature would again be subject to similar limitation as previously discussed. On the other hand, if the inclusion criterias are set in a way to reduce the bias discussed in question 1, then this feature could be quite interesting to measure if a goalie's performance decrease, remains stable, or increases as the game progresses. Taking a look at where (in terms of a 2D space representing the surface of the goal's entrance) the goalie seems to be most efficient in saving/conceding shots could definetly be a usefull feature to highlight the strenghts/weaknesses of a goalie's performance. If for instance most shots a goalie conceeds are located on the top-right space of the grid, then that information could definetly be usefull in different ways. The same type of information could be used but instead of using the 2D grid as a representation of the goal, it could be the location of the shot origin point on the ice, this would give a usefull indicator of a goalies performance in terms of where he/she is receiving a shot from on the ice. These two features could also be combined into one. It would also be relevant to use a feature measuring the goalie's performance in 1 v 1 scenarios for instance in the penalty shots scenario.
