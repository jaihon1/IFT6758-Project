## Warmup
Analyzing sports is becoming more and more valuable with the growth of various sensors and technology. In the case of hockey in partiular, be it a goalie or skater, there are certainly a wide range of metrics available for us to analyze the performace of hockey player.

### Question 1
In the case of hockey goalies, although using the Save Percentage (SV%) is a relatively good metric to measure a goalie's performance, it is certainly not without a set of limitations. The main one being the number of games played by the goalies.

> Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, it is a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal (From Wikipedia, Save Percentage).

*More information can be found here [save percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_percentage).*

For example, if we compare a goalie who only played one game to another goalie who played 50 games during the season. If the goalie who played the single game ended the game with zero goals conceded, he will have an average SV% of 100.00. In contrast, the goalie who played 50 games and has an average SV% of 95.00 will look like he was worst than the one with 100.00 SV%. Where in reality, the goalie who played only one game might had an "easier game" or even possibly only had to save a very low amount of low quality shots. Here is a visualization of the top 20 nhl goalies from the 2017-2018 season solely based on their save percentage metric:

![Top 20 Goalies 2017](/public/top-goalies-nomask.png)

Save percentage is probably the best metric we have for capturing a player's ability to stop shots but it is swamped by random variance, team effects and potentially sample size issues that kill any hope at meaningful confidence intervals. It leads to very little repeatability in goaltender performance, which makes it a struggle to forecast what many players will do in upcoming years.
The rule of thumb is that you would like to have a goalie’s save percentage to be 0.915% or higher. The league average is 0.910%.


A better metric would be for instance to set an inclusion criteria based on a preset threshold of games played for each goalie. For example, setting a threshold of at least 10 games played before even considering the goalie's performance on the 'Top goalies' analysis. This would be a way to control the 'low number of shots received with high number of saves' bias. Another, slighlty different inclusion criteria could be to simply set a threshold for the number of shots received by each goalie.

### Question 2
Here is a filtered visualization where we applied a mask that excluded goalies that had less than 10 games played during that same season:

### Question 3
There are many features that could optimise the estimation of a goalie's performance. Save Percentage, although limited in it's interpretation is actually quite relevant when used appropriately and within it's set of limitations. Here are a couple of features that could potentially be useful in determining a goalie's performance.

A useful feature could be the SV% for each of the 3 periods. This could be an indicator of performance in function of time, although this feature would again be subject to similar limitation as previously discussed. On the other hand, if the inclusion criterias are set in a way to reduce the bias discussed previously in question 1, then this feature could be quite interesting to measure if a goalie's performance decreases, remains stable, or increases as the game progresses.

Another interesting variation of the save percentage would be to observe and experiment with is the goalie's SV% during different states of a game. Such as the SV% when the goalie's team is leading, equal or trailling.

Taking a look at where (in terms of a 2D space representing the surface of the goal's entrance) the goalie seems to be the most efficient in saving/conceding shots could definitly be a useful feature to highlight the strengths/weaknesses of a goalie's performance. If for instance most shots a goalie conceeds are located on the top-right space of the grid, then that information could definitly be useful in different ways. The same type of information could be used but instead of using the 2D grid as a representation of the goal, it could be the location of the shot's origin point on the ice. This would give a useful indicator of a goalies performance in terms of where he/she is receiving a shot from on the ice. These two features could also be combined into one. It would also be relevant to use a feature measuring the goalie's performance in 1 v 1 scenarios for instance in the penalty shots scenario.

Also for the longest time, the most important stat for an NHL goalie was his Goals Against Average (“GAA”) which is simply the average number of goals let in per game. However, as the stats world developed GAA came to be seen as a better indicator of team performance than individual performance.

## Data Acquisition
The main objective here is to download hockey games through the NHL API, or simply load them if they already have been downloaded. For this purpose, we created a class called GamesInfo. Depending on the state of the local data files (whether the files have been downloaded or not), it will download or load all the games information taken from the json files in a dictionary where the keys are the season and the values are lists of dictionaries containing the information of each game.

In order to have a functional class, we will need the following libraries:

```python

from glob import glob
import requests
import json
import os

```

As shown by the next picture, to instantiate a GamesInfo object, we need to pass the season or a list of seasons that we want, either as a string, int, a list of strings or a list of ints.


```python
class GamesInfo:
    def __init__(
        self,
        season,
        filepath=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__)),
        games_info=None):
```


The second argument is the filepath
where to download the files in our situation, but also in the case where the files were already
downloaded. The third argument is games_info(dictionary of all the
games information) and is None by default. This is used if you want to instantiate an object of GamesInfo with a
dictionary that already contains all the information about the games instead of downloading them or loading them from
files.

Once the instance is created with the arguments, the class GamesInfo then generates an object
that contains all of the regular and playoff games from the specified seasons.

In our case, we only need the Download method. It downloads and saves the json files from the corresponding seasons in the specified filepath, then it returns a list of all the information about all the games of the season.

```python
def add_season(self, season):
```

```python
def __add__(self, other):
```

The class also has the load method which loads the json files already downloaded, the add_season method which adds
games from a new season in the object and the ```__add__``` method which implements the sum operator for the class in order
to combine two GamesInfo together. The ```__add__``` method returns a new GamesInfo object instance which contains all of the seasons from the two GamesInfo combined. If they share some seasons, only one will be kept, meaning that the new object
doesn't contain repetitions.


## Tidy Data

Here is a head display of the dataframe generated by aggregating all relevant games for all seasons ranging from 2016 to 2020:

### Strength Feature
Looking deeper into the API, we can observe that the *strength* feature is not always available. Only a *Goal* event has a property strength. In the future, there are a couple of ways we could associate the strength feature with the *Shot* or any other event.

#### Option 1
One way to implement the strength feature to SHOTS as well as the GOAL event would be to use the information given by the datetime element of the event: PENALTY, as demonstrated below:

```python
"result" : {
    "event" : "Penalty",
    "eventCode" : "OTT47",
    "eventTypeId" : "PENALTY",
    "description" : "Mark Borowiecki Fighting against Matt Martin",
    "secondaryType" : "Fighting",
    "penaltySeverity" : "Major",
    "penaltyMinutes" : 5,
},
"about" : {
    "eventIdx" : 74,
    "eventId" : 47,
    "period" : 1,
    "periodType" : "REGULAR",
    "ordinalNum" : "1st",
    "periodTime" : "13:25",
    "periodTimeRemaining" : "06:35",
    "dateTime" : "2016-10-12T23:42:40Z",
    "goals" : {
    "away" : 1,
    "home" : 2,
}
```

For instance, when a SHOT event is registered for player X of team A, one could iterate over each PENALTY event of this game that is at an inferior datetime from the SHOT event and that includes the SHOT event datetime when the penaltyMinutes value is added to it. Then, it would incrementally add + 1 to a counter that represents the number of players on the bench if the previous condition is met. By substracting the max number of players (6) by this counter value, one would end up with the number of players on ice (NoPoI) at that event. Once this is done for both teams, by comparing the NoPoI of each team at the event timepoint, one would be able to determine if the SHOT, or GOAL was at strength: Powerplay , Even or  Short Handed. In addition to that, one could also have the value of this strength feature (i.e: SHOT, Powerplay, 5-3).

#### Option 2
An alternative would be to use the power of our data structure to solve this problem. Because the game events are recorded and stored chronologically, we can use this to build an internal state of "team strength" for each team that is currently playing using the Penalty events and the periodTime property from our raw data.

For every penalty that creates a short-handed situation, we would have to update our current state of the team's penalty tracking component by storing its id, timestamp and duration. Then as the games goes, for each event, we use the periodTime feature of this event to update the active penalties that we are currently tracking (for both teams). This will allow us to update the duration left to a particular penalty, which is critical because a penalty that modifies the strength of a team will always have an end, and therefore our penalty tracking system must have a way to be made aware when a penalty ends.

That way, for any given event that happens throughout a game, we would be able to know the strength component of each team at any precise moment. We could then use this to add the "strength" feature, not only to the shot event, but any other event as well.

### Additional Features
An interesting feature that could be added would be to categorize the type of GOAL that was scored ('Goal type'). For example, as a rebound  GOAL or not. To implement this, one could, for each GOAL event, identify if a SHOT was taken at a specific timedelta interval between the SHOT and the GOAL. If that criteria is met, a "Rebound" observation could be added to the 'Goal type' feature. One could also identify a 'Lightning' Goal type if it was scored under a specific amount of time between the goal and a faceoff, and if that faceoff was located on the scoring team's ice. This could be used by selecting a GOAL event with: 1) A faceoff event close enough in terms of timedelta; 2) With x coordinates representing the scoring team's ice location.

Another feature could be goals or chances created by a team on the counter-attack. We could generate this feature using the raw data in the following way: we could first look at when a goalie saves the puck or when a defending player blocks a shot, and then we could check if there is another event right after this one that leads to a goal in the other end of the rink (in a predefined time window of 5-10 seconds). This way, we would be able to get a sense of what represents a goal scored on the counter-attack.

## Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

### Plot
{% include advanced_viz.html %}

### Discussion
There are many interpretations that we can get from the interactive plot shown above. As we can see, the plot's main focus is to show, for specific seasons, a team's shot quality and performance against the league average.

#### Interpretation
The most important interpretation that we can get out of this visualization is the following: What common characteristics does the *top teams* have vs the ones the *bottom teams* have. In other words, how can we represent a *good team* and a *bad team* through the analysis of this feature.

#### The logic behind
The logic behind the intuition of this interpretation is simple. In general, better performing teams will generate *better* shooting chances for themselves. What we mean by *better* shooting chances are shots coming mainly from three critical locations near the opponent's goaltender: right in the front of the net (anywhere from around 10 to 20 feet from the goal line), and near both faceoff circles close to the net. Through the data, we can observe that teams like the Colorado Avalanche and the Vegas Golden Knights, that respectively ended the 2020 season as first and second in the final standings (based on *[NHL](https://www.nhl.com/standings/2020/league)*), have a excess shot above average in those three specific locations.


### Study Case: Colorado Avalanche
If we are basing ourselves solely on the data from the plot, we can conlude that the Colorado Avalanche team from the 2016 season was mostly underperfoming because their shots are mostly below the league average in those three critical locations mentioned in the previous section (right in the front of the net, and near both faceoff circles close to the net).

Comparing these results to the the Colorado Avalanche team from the 2020 season, we can see a major improvement against the league average shots. Especially in those three critical locations. Given these observations, we could see why this team in 2020 was a much more successful, where they ended second place overall in the league compared to the 2016 where they dead ended last in the league!

In general, this feature does not paint the whole picture, but it gives us a great framework to analayze teams like the Colorado Avalanche from the 2016 and 2020 seasons.


### Study Case: Buffalo Sabres
The main differences between the Buffalo Sabres and the Tampa Bay Lightning seem to be that the Lightning do more shots closer
to the goal than the Sabres. The Sabres have generally lower excess shots than the league average in front of the goal and
where they do shoot more than the league average, they are rather spread out in the attacking zone. We could conclude from these
plots that the Sabres have a difficulty of penetrating their opponent's defence as oppose to the Lightning. Indeed, the Lightning, on the other hand, are not only able to shoot
closer to the goal as is shown by a high excess shots on the plots, but most of their excess shots that are positive are closer to the goal.
In other words, they seem to shoot more often closer to the goal than elsewhere. This might explain the Lightning's success. However, we do not
know if most of these shots are goals. It would be interesting to know how much of these were goals. Nevertheless, in general,
if the Lightning shoots more, they have more chance to make goals also.
