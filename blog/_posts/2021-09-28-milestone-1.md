## Warmup
Analyzing sports is becoming more and more valuable with the growth of various sensors and technology. In the case of hockey in partiular, be it a goalie or skater, there are certainly a wide range of metrics available for us to analyze the performace of hockey player.

### Question 1
In the case of hockey goalies, although using the Save Percentage (SV%) is a relatively good metric to measure a goalie's performance, it is certainly not without a set of limitations. The main one being the number of games played by the goalies.

> Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, it is a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal (Wikipedia, Save Percentage).

*Here is more information on [save percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_percentage).*

For example, if we compare a goalie who only played one game to another goalie who played 50 games during the season. If the goalie who played the single game ended the game with zero goals conceded, he will have an average SV% of 100.00. In contrast, the goalie who played 50 games and has an average SV% of 95.00 will look like he was worst than the one with 100.00 SV%. Where in reality, the goalie who played only one game might had an "easier game" or even possibly only had to save a very low amount of low quality shots. Here is a visualization of the top 20 nhl goalies from the 2017-2018 season solely based on their save percentage metric:

Save percentage is probably the best metric we have for capturing a player's ability to stop shots but it is swamped by random variance, team effects and potentially sample size issues that kill any hope at meaningful confidence intervals. It leads to very little repeatability in goaltender performance, which makes it a struggle to forecast what many players will do in upcoming years.
The rule of thumb is that you would like to have a goalie’s save percentage to be 0.915% or higher. The league average is 0.910% *[(Reference)](https://www.gaimday.com/blog/save-percentage/).*


A better metric would be for instance to set an inclusion criteria based on a preset threshold of games played for each goalie. For example, setting a threshold of at least 10 games played before even considering the goalie's performance on the 'Top goalies' analysis. This would be a way to control the 'low number of shots received with high number of saves' bias. Another, slighlty different inclusion criteria could be to simply set a threshold for the number of shots received by each goalie.

### Question 2
Here is a filtered visualization where we applied a mask that excluded goalies that had less than 10 games played during that same season:

### Question 3
There are many features that could optimise the estimation of a goalie's performance. Save Percentage, although limited in it's interpretation is actually quite relevant when used appropriately and within it's set of limitations. Here are a couple of features that could potentially be useful in determining a goalie's performance.

A useful feature could be the SV% for each of the 3 periods. This could be an indicator of performance in function of time, although this feature would again be subject to similar limitation as previously discussed. On the other hand, if the inclusion criterias are set in a way to reduce the bias discussed previously in question 1, then this feature could be quite interesting to measure if a goalie's performance decreases, remains stable, or increases as the game progresses.

Another interesting variation of the save percentage would be to observe and experiment with is the goalie's SV% during different states of a game. Such as the SV% when the goalie's team is leading, equal or trailling.

Taking a look at where (in terms of a 2D space representing the surface of the goal's entrance) the goalie seems to be the most efficient in saving/conceding shots could definitly be a useful feature to highlight the strengths/weaknesses of a goalie's performance. If for instance most shots a goalie conceeds are located on the top-right space of the grid, then that information could definitly be useful in different ways. The same type of information could be used but instead of using the 2D grid as a representation of the goal, it could be the location of the shot's origin point on the ice. This would give a useful indicator of a goalies performance in terms of where he/she is receiving a shot from on the ice. These two features could also be combined into one. It would also be relevant to use a feature measuring the goalie's performance in 1 v 1 scenarios for instance in the penalty shots scenario.

Also for the longest time, the most important stat for an NHL goalie was his Goals Against Average (“GAA”) which is simply the average number of goals let in per game. However, as the stats world developed GAA came to be seen as a better indicator of team performance than individual performance.

### Question 4
Here is a head display of the dataframe generated by aggregating all relevant games for all seasons ranging from 2016 to 2020.
![Dataframe all seasons](/public/df_screenshot.png)

One way to implement the strength feature to SHOTS as well as GOAL would be to use the information given by the datetime element of the event: PENALTY, as demonstrated below.
>

    "result" : {
          "event" : "Penalty",
          "eventCode" : "OTT47",
          "eventTypeId" : "PENALTY",
          "description" : "Mark Borowiecki Fighting against Matt Martin",
          "secondaryType" : "Fighting",
          "penaltySeverity" : "Major",
          "penaltyMinutes" : 5
        },
        "about" : {
          "eventIdx" : 74,
          "eventId" : 47,
          "period" : 1,
          "periodType" : "REGULAR",
          "ordinalNum" : "1st",
          "periodTime" : "13:25",
          "periodTimeRemaining" : "06:35",
          "dateTime" : "2016-10-12T23:42:40Z",
          "goals" : {
            "away" : 1,
            "home" : 2
          }
        }

For instance, when a SHOT event is registered for player X of team A, one could iterate over each PENALTY event of this game that is at an inferior datetime from the SHOT event and that includes the SHOT event datetime when the penaltyMinutes value is added to it. Then, it would incrementally add + 1 to a counter that represents the number of players on the bench if the previous condition is met. By substracting the max number of players (6) by this counter value, one would end up with the number of players on ice (NoPoI) at that event. Once this is done for both teams, by comparing the NoPoI of each team at the event timepoint, one would be able to determine if the SHOT, or GOAL was as strength: Powerplay , Even or  Short Handed. In addition to that, one could also have the value of this strength feature (i.e: SHOT, Powerplay, 5-3).


An interesting feature that could be added would be to categorize the type of GOAL that was scored ('Goal type'). For example, as a rebound  GOAL or not. To implement this, one could, for each GOAL event, identify if a SHOT was taken at a specific timedelta interval between the SHOT and the GOAL. If that criteria is met, a "Rebound" observation could be added to the 'Goal type' feature. One could also identify a 'Lightning' Goal type if it was scored under a specific amount of time between the goal and a faceoff, and if that faceoff was located on the scoring team's ice. This could be used by selecting a GOAL event with: 1) A faceoff event close enough in terms of timedelta; 2) With x coordinates representing the scoring team's ice location.


### Question 5
We have chosen the season 2016. The most dangerous type of shot in the 2016 Season is the
deflected type with a Percentage of scoring shots of 19.8 % followed by the Tip-In with
17.9 %.

![img_2.png](/public/img_2.png)

The most common type of shot in the season 2016 is the Wrist Shot with 38 056 shots
followed by the Slap Shot with 12 691 shots.

![img_1.png](/public/img_1.png)

The relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal
has been produce in 3 figures, one figure for 2018, one figure for 2019,
and one figure for to 2020.
The figure below describes the chance of scoring a goal in function of shot
distance for the season 2018.  The highest percentage is 23.76 for the shortest shot distance
interval (1 feet to 5.8 feets), which is logical because it is very close to the net.
Then the percentage slowly decreases the more distant we are from the net, and at 60 feets,
it reaches a percentage of 2.1 and then the percentage stays between 2 and 5 until the distance
of 98 feets.
![img_3.png](/public/img_3.png)

For the 2019 season, the figure below describes the chance of scoring a goal in function
of shot distance. The highest percentage is 24.49 for the shortest shot distance
interval (1 feet to 5.8 feets), which is logical because it is very close to the net.
Then at 60 feets, it reaches a percentage of 2.48, and then the percentage stays between 2 and 6 until the distance
of 98 feets.

![img_5.png](/public/img_5.png)

Then for the 2020 season, the figure below describes the chance of scoring a goal in
function of shot distance. The highest percentage is 23.16 for the shortest shot distance
interval (1 feet to 5.8 feets), which is the closest distance to the net.
Then at 45 feets, it reaches 2.93 of percentage then oscillates beteween 2 and 8 percent until 98 feets.

![img_6.png](/public/img_6.png)

What is interesting, is that it has not been much much change on teh relationship of the three seasons 2018, 2019, and 2020.

In all the seasons, it begins with a peak at the shortest distance(very close to the net), then in all the seasons, it reaches one of the
lowest percentage at mid-distance between 45 and 60 feets, then the percentage stays stable with small oscillations until 98 feets.
All our results are consistent with the common rules of Hockey and the common laws of physics that could explain those percentages
variations.
